/* use effect download at the top to use.@

use the hook in the function above the component
to use the hook we have to type useEffect () with a argument so with a dependenacy array

useEffect (()=> { 
console.log 'useEffect ran'; 
}, []);


what do we add to useEffect array as a state value to allow the use effect to monitor ? the state of a journal being posted and button to delete.

JSON
make a data folder in src level
Make a db file called db.json in the data folder
Make a fake journal from the use state we already have as a dummy
